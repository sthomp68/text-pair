#summary PhiloLine Bugs and To Do List

= PhiloLine version 0d. =

   * To Do: Add handler for nested divs to shingler and aligner to allow access to subarticles and other objects below "div1".

   * Bug/Logic error: I think I found a few minor bugs in mkshinglesbatch.pl. If $DoFlattenAccents is true, I think it should call &FlattenAccents on each of the stop words. For example, I ran it on FILENAME and noticed there were a bunch of "etait"s in the shingles even though "était" is in the stop words file.

   * Bug/Logic error: Another problem that I found is that the length check for $DeleteShortWords should be moved further down in &SelectAndMassageWord. It needs to be moved after the call to &DoVirtNorm. Otherwise, the word might be replaced with a short one and it won't get filtered.

   * Bug?: mkshinglesbatch.pl: In mapping bytes to div objects, if there is a DIV with NO words, which is really a tagging error, it generates an out of range sequence error. Not sure this is a bug, since complete empty divs are an encoding error.  But, the patch is to change:

{{{
if ($DoDivLevelObjects) {
			$thisdivid = $divid[$z];           # Do byte mapping to div ids.
			if ($offset > $divsbyte[$z]) {
				$z++;
				$thisdivid = $divid[$z];
				if ($offset > $divsbyte[$z]) {
					print "ERROR Seq $z $offset $divsbyte[$z] \n";
					exit;
					}
				}
			}
}}}

  * makeshinglesbatch.pl: div mapping does not include structural encoding such as "<front", so object maps can get out of sequence.
